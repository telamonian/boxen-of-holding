#Boxen of Holding
  A directory for holding all of your Boxen related repos while you work on them
  
##Setup scripts
  Run the root level setup.sh script from you shiny new VM, and it should take care of setting up and running Boxen. Currently runs on OSX and linux. Caveat: the linux version will make some potentially odd assumptions about where you keep your Boxen modules dev code.
